- mount
typically host has your created files, but container does not. container is a space with container image that enables us to launch the environement from the image
container replicate the files you create but since the storage would be too big, we just execute non-existed files from host

$cd ~/Desktop
$mkdir mounted_folder
$touch mounted_folder/file_at_host
$docker built .
$docker run -it -v ~/Desktop/mounted_folder:/new_dir <image> bash (docker run -it -v /Users/yutahayashi/udemy/subl_projects/mounted_folder:/new_dir  99ffc963370a bash)
created new_dir in container. file_at_host replicated in new_dir
$ls /new_dir

dockerfile lets you create new_dir in container 
if host /mounted_filder/file_at_host is modified, its reflected on new_dir/file_at_host on the container as well
