docker run ubuntu
  this does not keep the container open. if you run this command, it exits automatically


-it is an aggragate of -i and -t
  
-i STDIN connecting host to container
-t makes the output format pretty

as input channel is closed, if you run docker -t ubuntu bash, and run ls, it results in nothing. -t only makes the output pretty
if you run docker -i, it seems that nothing has been returned but the program still works
