as you process docker, there are so many containers existed, and no need to process them anymore: you need remove them 

remove:
1) docker rm <container id>
  if container status is 'up', you cannot remove the containers, if that is the case
  
2) docker stop <container id>
  verify with docker ps -a
  
3) docker system prune
  remove all the stopped containers
